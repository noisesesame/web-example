      <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web
        resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
        interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred
        via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web
        browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web is not synonymous
        with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the
        Web is built.</p>
